## How to file issues and get help  

This project uses GitHub Issues to track bugs and feature requests. Please search the existing issues before filing new issues to avoid duplicates.  For new issues, file your bug or feature request as a new Issue.

Issues can be created and searched through for existing issues here: [https://github.com/Azure/ALZ-Bicep/issues](https://github.com/Azure/ALZ-Bicep/issues)

Please provide as much information as possible when filing an issue. Include screenshots or correlation IDs if possible (please redact any sensitive information).

For instructions on how to get deployments and correlation ID, please follow this link [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/deployment-history?tabs=azure-portal#get-deployments-and-correlation-id).

We may ask you to create an Azure support request once we have triaged the issue following the process documented [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-portal/supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request)

## Community Support Policy
