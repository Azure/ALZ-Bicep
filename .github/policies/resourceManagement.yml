            Hey ${issueAuthor}, thanks for creating this PR.


            We noticed that this PR is ammending some things related to policies (definitions or assignments) :mag:


            Thanks for this however, please keep in mind we replicate all policies from our upstream repo https://github.com/Azure/Enterprise-Scale (via some GitHub Actions) into these Bicep modules.


            So it may be that this PR may be closed and we ask you to re-submit the changes to the respective code in our other repo.


            However, we will review and advise further anyway but this is just a friendly premptive message and reminder of how policies are used and updated in this repo.


            Thanks from your friendly msft-bot.

            We have determined, upon our review, that the changes here are required to be made to the upstream policies in the repo: https://github.com/Azure/Enterprise-Scale


            Thanks from the team and our friendly msft-bot.
