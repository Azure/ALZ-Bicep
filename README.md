## Overview
The Azure Landing Zones Bicep repo provides an approach for deploying and managing the core platform capabilities of Cloud Adoption Framework Azure Landing Zones conceptual architecture using Bicep.

In its current incarnation each module can be deployed separately via command line but in future releases a more automated approach, via orchestration modules, will be published; but due to current Bicep & ARM limitations this is not possible today.

## Getting Started

To get started with ALZ Bicep, please refer to the [Deployment Flow wiki page][wiki_deployment_flow] for:
1. Prerequisites and dependencies for the overall implementation.
2. High-level deployment flow.
3. Links to more detailed instructions on individual modules.
