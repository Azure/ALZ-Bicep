parPolicyAssignmentDisplayName | Yes      | The display name of the policy assignment. e.g. "Deny the creation of Public IPs"
parPolicyAssignmentDescription | Yes      | The description of the policy assignment. e.g. "This policy denies creation of Public IPs under the assigned scope."

parPolicyAssignmentIdentityRoleAssignmentsAdditionalMgs | No       | An array containing a list of additional Management Group IDs (as the Management Group deployed to is included automatically) that the System-assigned Managed Identity, associated to the policy assignment, will be assigned to additionally. e.g. ['alz', 'alz-sandbox' ].
parPolicyAssignmentIdentityRoleAssignmentsSubs | No       | An array containing a list of Subscription IDs that the System-assigned Managed Identity associated to the policy assignment will be assigned to in addition to the Management Group the policy is deployed/assigned to. e.g. ['8200b669-cbc6-4e6c-b6d8-f4797f924074', '7d58dc5d-93dc-43cd-94fc-57da2e74af0d' ].
