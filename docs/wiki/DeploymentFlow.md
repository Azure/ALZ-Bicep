# Azure Landing Zones Bicep - Deployment Flow

This document outlines the prerequisites, dependencies and flow to help orchestrate an end-to-end Azure Landing Zone deployment.  The orchestration templates provided with this reference implementation have been pre-configured to follow the dependencies described in this document.

## Prerequisites

1. Azure Active Directory Tenant.
2. Minimum 1 subscription.  Subscription(s) are required when configuring `Log Analytics Workspace` & `Hub Networking` services.  Each can be deployed in the same subscription or separate subscriptions based on deployment requirements.
3. Deployment Identity with `Owner` permission to the `/` root management group.  Owner permission is required to allow the Service Principal Account to create role-based access control assignments.  See [configuration instructions below](#deployment-identity).

## Deployment Identity

### Service Principal Account

A service principal account is required to automate through Azure DevOps or GitHub Workflows. 

- **Service Principal Name**:  any name (i.e. `spn-azure-platform-ops`)
- **RBAC Assignment**
  - Scope:  `/` (Root Management Group)
  - Role Assignment:  `Owner`

> See [step-by-step instructions on Azure Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/deploy-to-tenant?tabs=azure-powershell#required-access) to configure the role assignment at `/` root management group.

### Configure Service Principal Account in Azure DevOps or GitHub

- Azure DevOps: [Setup Service Connection](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/library/service-endpoints?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml)

- GitHub: [Connect GitHub Actions to Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/developer/github/connect-from-azure)
