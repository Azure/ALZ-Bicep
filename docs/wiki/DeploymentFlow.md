## Prerequisites

1. Azure Active Directory Tenant.
2. Minimum 1 subscription.  Subscription(s) are required when configuring `Log Analytics Workspace` & `Hub Networking` services.  Each can be deployed in the same subscription or separate subscriptions based on deployment requirements.
3. Deployment Identity with `Owner` permission to the `/` root management group.  Owner permission is required to allow the Service Principal Account to create role-based access control assignments.  See [configuration instructions below](#deployment-identity).

## High Level Deployment Flow

## Network Topology Deployment

You can decide which network topology to implement that meets your requirements. Please review the network topologies [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/define-an-azure-network-topology). The following lists examples of network topology deployment based on the recommended enterprise-scale architecture:

- [Traditional VNet Hub and Spoke](https://github.com/Azure/ALZ-Bicep/wiki/DeploymentFlowHS) - Supports communication, shared resources and centralized security policy.
- [Virtual WAN](https://github.com/Azure/ALZ-Bicep/wiki/DeploymentFlowVWAN) - Supports large-scale branch-to-branch and branch-to-Azure communications.

### What if we have no "hub" or don't need one?

If in your networking topology there is no concept of a hub then you can use either the [Hub Networking Module](https://github.com/Azure/ALZ-Bicep/tree/main/infra-as-code/bicep/modules/hubNetworking), if you require deploying resource like Azure Firewall, Bastion, VPN/ExpressRoute Gateways etc., **or** the [Spoke Networking Module](https://github.com/Azure/ALZ-Bicep/tree/main/infra-as-code/bicep/modules/spokeNetworking) to just deploy your spoke networking infrastructure based on your requirements.

## Orchestration Modules

We have some orchestration modules (Bicep files that wrap/call other Bicep modules) available to help simplify and reduce the number of deployments. These are completely optional to use but may be useful for your requirements.

> If you have any suggestions for additional orchestration modules please raise a [feature request](https://github.com/Azure/ALZ-Bicep/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature-request---.md&title=%F0%9F%92%A1+Feature+Request+-+PLEASE+CHANGE+ME+TO+SOMETHING+DESCRIPTIVE)

The current available orchestration modules are listed below:

| Module          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Module Documentation                                                                                                                                |

> Orchestration modules to deliver the entire ALZ deployment in a single Bicep file are on our backlog and being worked on, stay tuned!

## Deployment Identity

When first working with Management Groups, the Azure AD Global Administrator must assign the User Access Administrator role to themselves at the `/` scope first before being able to further delegate. See [Elevate access to manage all Azure subscriptions and management groups](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/elevate-access-global-admin) documentation for further information.

In addition, the identity that wants to create a Tenant scope deployment must have the *Owner* role assigned to the `/` root management group. Whether this is your user account (even if a Global Administrator) or a Service Principal. See [Required access for Tenant deployments on Azure Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/deploy-to-tenant?tabs=azure-powershell#required-access).

### Service Principal Account

A service principal account is required to automate through Azure DevOps or GitHub Workflows. This can be created through the [Portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal), [Azure PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-authenticate-service-principal-powershell) or [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli).

- **Service Principal Name**:  any name (i.e. `spn-azure-platform-ops`)
- **RBAC Assignment**
  - Scope:  `/` (Root Management Group)
  - Role Assignment:  `Owner`

### Configure Service Principal Account in Azure DevOps or GitHub

- Azure DevOps: [Setup Service Connection](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/library/service-endpoints?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml)

- GitHub: [Connect GitHub Actions to Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/github/connect-from-azure)

## Consumption Methods

The `ALZ-Bicep` modules can be consumed and used in a manner of different ways. For more information see the [Consumer Guide](https://github.com/Azure/ALZ-Bicep/wiki/ConsumerGuide).
