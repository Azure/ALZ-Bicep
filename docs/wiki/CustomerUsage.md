## Telemetry Tracking Using Customer Usage Attribution (PID)
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

Microsoft can identify the deployments of the Azure Resource Manager and Bicep templates with the deployed Azure resources. Microsoft can correlate these resources used to support the deployments. Microsoft collects this information to provide the best experiences with their products and to operate their business. The telemetry is collected through [customer usage attribution](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/azure-partner-customer-usage-attribution). The data is collected and governed by Microsoft's privacy policies, located at the [trust center](https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter).

To disable this tracking, we have included a parameter called `parTelemetryOptOut` to every bicep module in this repo with a simple boolean flag. The default value `false` which **does not** disable the telemetry. If you would like to disable this tracking, then simply set this value to `true` and this module will not be included in deployments and **therefore disables** the telemetry tracking.

If you are happy with leaving telemetry tracking enabled, no changes are required. Please do not edit the module name or value of the variable `varCuaid` in any module.

For example, in the managementGroups.bicep file, you will see the following:

```bicep
@description('Set Parameter to True to Opt-out of deployment telemetry')
param parTelemetryOptOut bool = true
```

The default value is `false`, but by changing the parameter value `true` and saving this file, when you deploy this module either via PowerShell, Azure CLI, or as part of a pipeline the module deployment below will be ignored and therefore telemetry will not be tracked.

```bicep
// Optional Deployment for Customer Usage Attribution
module modCustomerUsageAttribution '../../CRML/customerUsageAttribution/cuaIdTenant.bicep' = if (!parTelemetryOptOut) {
  name: 'pid-${varCuaid}-${uniqueString(deployment().location)}'
  params: {}
}
```

## Module PID Value Mapping

The following are the unique ID's (also known as PIDs) used in each of the modules:

| Module Name                       | PID                                  |

### Zero Trust Networking Telemetry

In an aligned effort with the Azure Networking Product Group, we have created an additional telemetry collection point to help us see customer choosing to adopt Zero Trust Networking best practices from ALZ.

> There will be multiple phases for Zero Trust Networking in ALZ that will mean additional telemetry collection points being added over time. This will only be captured when you run a portal deployment and select to leave telemetry collection enabled.

#### ALZ Bicep - Zero Trust Networking - Phase 1 | Definition

The following conditions and their values must be met for the telemetry point to be triggered for collection:

1. Enable DDOS Protection is `true` in Hub and Spoke or Virtual WAN topologies
2. Deploy Azure Firewall is `True` in Hub and Spoke or Virtual WAN topologies
3. Azure Firewall Tier is `Premium` in Hub and Spoke or Virtual WAN topologies
4. Ensure subnets are associated with NSG is `true` in both Landing Zones & Identity Management Groups
5. Ensure secure connections to storage accounts (https) is `true` in the Landing Zones Management Group

#### ALZ Bicep - Zero Trust Networking - Phase 1 | PID Mapping

| Telemetry Collection Point | PID                                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Definition points 1, 2 & 3 | 3ab23b1e-c5c5-42d4-b163-1402384ba2db |
| Definition points 4 & 5    | 4eaba1fc-d30a-4e63-a57f-9e6c3d86a318 |
